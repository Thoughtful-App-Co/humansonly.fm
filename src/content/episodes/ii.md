App stickiness is now akin to brain rot, as platforms pull in daily users to the deep abysses of their own shorted biological processes.

In this episode, we explore the dark side of UX design—the manipulative patterns that exploit our psychology to keep us hooked, clicking, and scrolling against our better judgment.

## Topics Covered

- The evil arts in user experience design
- Dark patterns and deceptive design in modern apps
- Variable rewards and dopamine manipulation
- Threat signaling through notifications
- Attention depletion and decision fatigue
- Social comparison as an engagement mechanic
- How dark patterns violate user autonomy
- Self-Determination Theory and ethical alternatives

"Checking Email Less Frequently Reduces Stress." *Computers in Human Behavior*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214005810) — Direct experimental evidence: Limiting email checks to 3x daily significantly reduces daily stress compared to unlimited checking.

### Dark Patterns & Deceptive Design

- [Deceptive.Design (Harry Brignull)](https://www.deceptive.design/) — Founded 2010, originally "darkpatterns.org". Coined the term and provides comprehensive catalog of deceptive patterns.

### Regulatory Context

- **EU Digital Services Act** — Incorporates deceptive patterns framework
- **DETOUR Act (US)** — Proposed legislation to make dark patterns illegal for large platforms
- **FTC Enforcement** — Epic Games ($245M settlement), Noom ($62M settlement), Intuit (ongoing)
