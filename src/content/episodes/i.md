In this inaugural episode, we introduce the philosophy of the podcast: human-first, technology-second. We explore why a semi-anti-technology perspective matters in today's AI-saturated world. Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around.

We discuss the core principles of "thoughtful software" and why minimalism isn't just an aesthetic choice, but a functional necessity in an age of information overload.
